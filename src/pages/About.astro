            I especially like to write code I can read again, or that someone else can read. This is sometimes called "<span class="font-bold text-orange-300">clean code</span>", and it means something different to every developer.<br/><br/>To me, it means <span class="font-bold text-orange-300">maintenance</span> above all else. Code that can be read (preferably once) and understood, both by me when I inevitably forget about it, and as a bonus anyone else who happens to read it.<br/><br/>Code that takes more brain power to understand is harder to maintain. Code that doesn't test itself is harder to maintain. Tests that attempt too much at once are harder to understand, and harder to maintain.
            <br/><br/>All code decays, good maintenance means we can hold it together until the robots can do it for us.
            <br/><br/>Aside from writing code for work, I've also been writing an RPG game in Godot, am an avid practitioner of Tai Chi, and spend entirely too much time with my cats.
